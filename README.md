 ## ðŸŽ“ University Examination System Database

This project presents a comprehensive **relational database design** for a university's examination system. It models academic entities such as departments, faculty, students, courses, and exams â€” along with their relationships â€” to support essential administrative and academic functionalities.

### ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- Models university structure: departments, courses, faculty, students.
- Tracks who teaches, coordinates, and creates exams for each course.
- Manages student enrollments, attendance, and exam attempts.
- Supports both internal and external exam types.
- Maintains data integrity with foreign keys and constraints.
